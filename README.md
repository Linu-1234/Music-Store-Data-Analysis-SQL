# Music-Store-Data-Analysis-SQL
This project involves analyzing a music store database to extract valuable insights through SQL queries.

## Description
The database contains information about customers, invoices, tracks, genres, artists, and more. Using PostgreSQL, I have written and executed queries to answer a range of business-related questions, such as identifying top customers, best-selling artists, popular genres by country, and cities with the highest revenue.

The project is divided into three levels of complexity:
- Easy: Queries to find straightforward insights, such as the senior-most employee, top invoice values, and the best customers.
- Moderate: Queries to identify rock music listeners, top rock artists, and tracks longer than the average song length.
- Advanced: Complex queries to determine spending per customer on specific artists, the most popular genres by country, and the highest-spending customers in each country.

This project demonstrates advanced SQL skills, including the use of JOINs, CTEs, window functions, and aggregations, to solve real-world data analysis problems. It serves as a comprehensive example of how relational databases can be utilized to drive decision-making in a business context. 

## Tools
- PostgreSQL: For writing and executing SQL queries to analyze the music store database.
- pgAdmin: A graphical interface to manage and interact with the PostgreSQL database.
